Applied JSON Dictionaries to store text data, amassing 350+ articles and approximately 560,000 words, including all respective companies, headlines, authors,  and sentiment figures.Built a robust training algorithm with 3 criteria and 2 worked-out examples to optimize a sub-model named entity recognition (NER) capabilities.'},
        {title: 'Market-Vision', description: 'Created a model that utilizes pandas to gather, organize, and score financial data from 30 active stocks daily based on 5 technical and 6 fundamental analysis standards. Utilized JSON Dictionaries to store ticker info and provide a historical reference to train OpenAI API-driven learning model to average past scores.Optimized model efficiency to bring OpenAI’s API usage cost per 1,000,000 tokens from $10.00 to $0.15 by refining data organization and model training instructions.'},
        {title: 'PyTorch-Projects', description: 'Deployed pre-trained neural and cycle-GAN networks with PyTorch to perform computer vision and image domain transformation tasks. Utilized NumPy to organize 700+ batches of text, tabular, time-series, and image data in 3 dimensions and higher. Implemented ImageNet 1000+ database of images and ground truths into models for reference.'},
